    "text": "I am a strong advocate for quality, Catholic education—having attended Catholic school since kindergarten through my college years at the Chaminade Unversity of Honolulu. Education is the foundation that unlocks endless opportunities and exposes us to different connections within our community.\nAs the only child to immigrant parents from the Philippines, I advocate for young adults of Filipino decent, especially in Hawaii, like myself, to be aware of their roots and heritage that makes us Filipino."
